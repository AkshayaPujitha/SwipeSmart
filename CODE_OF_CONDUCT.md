# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being empathetic and understanding towards other community members.
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on the issues and ideas being discussed, not attacking individuals or groups.
- Showing kindness and consideration to others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or offensive comments related to any of the protected characteristics mentioned above.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory remarks.
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Contributors who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be temporarily or permanently banned from participating in the project's community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the project's community spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [maintainer email]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
