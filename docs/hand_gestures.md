# Hand Gesture Recognition with cvzone and Data Collection

## Introduction

Hand gesture recognition is a computer vision application that involves detecting and interpreting hand movements to trigger specific actions. In this project, we use the `cvzone` library, which builds on top of OpenCV, to simplify the process of hand gesture recognition. Additionally, we perform data collection using the `HandTracking` module provided by `cvzone`.

## About cvzone

`cvzone` is a Python library that provides various utilities to work with computer vision tasks, including object detection, pose estimation, and hand tracking. It extends the functionalities of OpenCV and makes it easier to build computer vision applications. The library includes modules like `HandTracking`, which we will use to detect and track hand movements.

## HandGesture Recognition

We utilize the `HandTracking` module from `cvzone` to track the user's hand in real-time through their device's camera. Once the hand is detected, we use the position and movements of the fingers to recognize specific hand gestures. The library provides methods to identify common gestures like swipe left, swipe right, scroll up, scroll down, and tapping.

## Data Collection with HandTracking

To create a robust hand gesture recognition model, we need a diverse dataset of hand gestures. `cvzone` simplifies the data collection process using the `HandTracking` module. By displaying the live camera feed, the module tracks the hand's key points, including the finger positions, which are captured as data for each gesture.

The data collection process involves the following steps:

1. Start the `HandTracking` module and display the camera feed.
2. Perform the hand gestures we want to collect data for (e.g., swipe left, swipe right, scroll up, scroll down, tap).
3. Record hand movements corresponding to each gesture.
4. Save the collected data for each gesture into a directoy named data.
